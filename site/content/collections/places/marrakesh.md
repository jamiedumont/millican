description: "Marrakesh is a special place. It feels developed, yet wild all at the same time. We loved visiting the souk and the markets, but you really had to have your wits about you! The riding just outside the city was quite flat, so we headed further out to the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. There we found some of the best trails we've ever encountered. The locals in the small villages were incredibly welcoming and the mint tea they offered us was awesome and thick with sugar."
