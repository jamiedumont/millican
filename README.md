# Millican
A Statamic theme for travel bloggers

## What is this?
Millican is a travel blog that lets you link your posts to the places that you've visited. Tell a story for those back home to follow with rich content like videos, images and galleries.

The two main Collections are "Posts" and "Places" and can be managed totally separate of one another, or related. They have taxonomies of "Categories" and "Countries" to better organise content.

The content areas are powered by Bard with a few content sets to get you started. The theme is styled with TailwindCSS so is totally customisable if that's your thing.

Millican is lightweight and fast. All images are optimised with Glide and cached, and the CSS weighs in at just ~~40kB~~ 3kB (with use of PurgeCSS) and JS at 16kB. Even on a modest server you should be seeing sub-second load times (image and location dependent of course).

## The theme's history
For a time, I made some themes for Statamic to sell on their marketplace. I released a couple (one free, this one paid) but found the demand lackluster, and the sales didn't match up to the time invested on each theme. I also began to experience more frustrations building with Statamic, both in these themes and in my client work â€” particularly with a number of addons.

I decided to focus my attention on the work that I enjoyed (custom applications with Elixir) and problems I wanted to solve (a Crossfit app that properly tracked an athletes progress). That meant stepping back from my client work (with Statamic), the theme building and the tutorials that I used to publish on my blog.

I'm opening up all my private repos in the hope that someone might find them useful, even if the sites aren't complete or exactly matching your usecase.
